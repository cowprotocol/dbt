      This is a temporary source that needs to be replaced by the actual data dump we will do:
      We will periodically upload new data from the backend db to the analytics db. 
      When we do this, we need to make sure that there is a column (named updated_at for example)
      which indicates when the row was uploaded to our analytics database.
      Then, we can use this column to incrementaly load the data inside of the staging model
      and make follow up models incremental too if we want.

          We also which solver won for each auction and the score of each proposed solution.

    description: > 
      This is a temporary source that needs to be replaced by the actual data dump (like for the temp_backend_db_dump schema).
      This data is temporarily under the schema aurelie because I did not have write access to the temp_backend_db_dump schema
      when doing a partial data synch from the backend db to the analytics db with dune synch v2.
