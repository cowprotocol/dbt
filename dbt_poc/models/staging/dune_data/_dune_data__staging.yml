      In theory, this should be enough to make sure it is new data if the automation logic to get data from Dune stands.
      But, in case there is a mistake, we also added the strategy that 
      the incremental model looks at a combintation of columns that should be unique
      and deletes those rows in case it inserts a new row with a newer updated_at that has the same data.

      Same logic as the stg_dune_data__vouch model
