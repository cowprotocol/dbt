      this is a temporary source that needs to be replaced by the actual dune extract and load job we will be doing.

          This come frome the dune table cow_protocol_ethereum.VouchRegister_evt_Vouch
          We only vouch if a new solver joins (say, every few weeks) or when solvers change their reward target address (happens less often).
          This table is not uploaded by us. Instead, it is indexed directly from the blockchain by Dune.
