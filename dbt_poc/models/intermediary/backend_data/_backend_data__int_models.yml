models:
  - name: int_backend_data__settlements_in_time
    description: >
      Includes all the auctions from the competition_auction table (so normally all of our auctions).
      We add two new columns that indicate if the auction is settled (tx_has exists) and if it is settled on time.
      We include a grace period (see model code for the exact amount)
  - name: int_backend_data__two_highest_scores
    description: > 
      Model that simply adds two new columns to the proposed solutions:
      One with the max score for that auction, 
      and one with the second highest score for the aution (or 0 if it does not exist).
      All the auctions and their associated proposed solutions are still present.
      In case the logic for calculating the reward for the auction changes and is not
      based solely on the two highest scores for the auction, then we need to change this model.
  - name: int_backend_data__reward_calculation
    description: For each auction, we calculate the final rewards, wethere the auction is settled or not, on time or not. 
      The reward is only given if the solver settled on time and if they were declared the winner, otherwise they are penalised.
