  - name: int_dune_data__valid_vouches
    description: >
      List of all the solvers and their reward target address with a valid vouch. 
      This means that one of bonding pools we trust has vouched for the solver.
      ! This table can not be used to send rewards as we do not yet know if the solver has been un-vouched after:
      an entry in this table only means that a solver has been vouhed for at one point in time. 
      Needs to be compared with the int_dune_data__valid_unvouches table to identify the dinal list of vouched solvers.
    columns:
      - name: reward_target
        data_tests:
          - not_null
      - name: is_vouched
        description: >
          New column added in this model which is always set to true here.
          We will use it later when joining with the unvouched table to keep track of which solver was vouched for or unvouched for.
  - name: int_dune_data__valid_unvouches
    description: >
     List of all the solver and their reward target address with a valid unvouch.
     This means that one of the bonding pools we trust has unvouched these solvers.
    columns:
      - name: is_vouched
        description: >
          New column added in this model which is always set to false here.
          We will use it later when joining with the vouched table to keep track of which solver was vouched for or unvouched for.
  - name: int_dune_data__invalid_vouched
    description: >
      All the vouches found in the dune source table for vouches which where not validated by one of the bonding pools we trust.
      Hopefully, this table is as empty as possible.
      Todo later: create a custom dbt test and tracking table to warn whenever a new entry appears in this table. 
  - name: int_dune_data__actual_valid_vouches
    description: >
     one row per solver. This solver has been:
     1. vouched by a bonding pool we trust
     2. not unvouched by a bonding pool we trust AFTER being vouched for
     If the two conditions are met and the solver still has multiple valid target address (multiple bonding pools vouched for them and did not unvouch after),
     then we keep the earliest row and it's relevant target address.
     This sql query was modified compareed to the Dune query (number 1541516) it was based on. 
     Because we use PostgreSQL here we can be more efficient by stopping scanning rows for a group once the first match is found (early exit behavior)
     and because we do not use extra memory to assign ranks to all rows.
     We could augment efficiency if our tables were indexed on solver and the time columns
