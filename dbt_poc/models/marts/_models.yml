# Data marts are the final models, and often a join between multiple data sources so we name them by their type: facts (fct) or dimensions (dim)
#Fact tables capture the quantitative essence of business events – sales, clicks, shipments. Dimension tables provide the crucial context – who, what, where, when
# What would be an example for a dimension in the context at hand?
