tests:
  - name: assert_if_dbt_accounting_is_correct
    description: > 
      Test to make sure that the accounting logic implemented in dbt is correct. 
      We compare the rewards from the dbt accounting logic to thhe one found in the original accounting in dune.
      This tests passes if nothing is returned because we select rows where the results are different.
      Possible ToDo later: at the moment, we query in dune the results of the transaction hashes that we have in dbt to minimize the rows returned (800 instead of more than 800 000)
      When we add more transactions in thhe dbt logic, we could make sure to compare them too.
