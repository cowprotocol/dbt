  - name: int_accounting_period_data__conversion_rates
    description: >
      For each accounting period and block number, the conversion rate from native to cow.
      Accounting periods are from Tuesdays 00:00 (inclusive) to Tuesday 00:00 (exclusive). 
      On ethereum (i.e. with second granularity) it can be written as from Tuesdays 00:00:00 to Monday 23:59:59. 
      This should also work on chains like arbitrum with multiple blocks per second. Not sure if there are compatible chains with e.g. millisecond time stamps.
  - name : int_accounting_period_data__partner_and_protocol_fees
    description: >
      The calculation to find the actual transfer that need to be made for the partner and protocol fees.
      This is kept as a separate view because it might be interesting to be able to see all the columns that are used for the calculation.
      But, for the final data mart we only select a few columns to make it easier to use daily.
