# Data marts are the final models, and often a join between multiple data sources so we name them by their type: facts (fct) or dimensions (dim)
#Fact tables capture the quantitative essence of business events – sales, clicks, shipments. Dimension tables provide the crucial context – who, what, where, when
# all data marts (unless specified otherwise are in atoms of the token (eg wei not eth))

      A trade is an execution of an order. There are partially fillable orders, so one order can be executed in multiple times.
      It is also the name of the trade events that are on-chain.
      network_fee_amount and other amounts are in the token (not native)

      TODO Tests: 
       - tx_hash and order_uid unique combo.
       - protocol_fee_amount should not be above 1 percent of buy amount for buy order or sell amount of sell order (in the trades table for amounts, and type of order in the order table)

      Most of the time, an auction_id should only have one tx_hash, but it could be that a solver settled when he should not (then is_winner is false)
      and we might want in the future to allow for multiple solutions per auction.
      We can use this table as a basis to know which solver to pay or penalise, 
      as well as the protocol feess, networks fees, execution costs (still TODO), and slippage.
